# Visualization for Smart Meter Assembly Line - Quality Analysis

## Basic information

- Date: Apr. 2018 - Dec. 2018
- Description: The software is mainly used to monitor the quality of metering positions in the verification assembly line of smart meters. By monitoring the data uploaded to the database of verification devices, the algorithm is used to get the detection results, and the detection results are visually displayed in the UI.

## Requirements

- OS: Windows 7, 8 and 10
- Database: Oracle
