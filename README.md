# Visualization for Smart Meter Assembly Line - Quality Analysis

## Basic information

- Date: Apr. 2018 - Dec. 2018
- Description: The software is mainly used to monitor the quality of metering positions in the verification assembly line of smart meters. By monitoring the data uploaded to the database of verification devices, the algorithm is used to get the detection results, and the detection results are visually displayed in the UI.

## Requirements

- OS: Windows 7, 8 and 10
- Database: Oracle

## Accomplishments

- Software patent: Anomaly Detection and Quality Control System for the Verification Assembly Line of Smart Meters (CN 2019SR0423927)
- Undergraduate thesis: Software Design Oriented to Analysis of Verification Data of Smart Meter - Zhiwei Bao 

## Application

- This software is serving for a provincial metering center of State Grid
